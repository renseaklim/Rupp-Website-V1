                            <p>The Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), founded in 1960, has undergone a series of
                                transformations to become the leading national university in Cambodia. Other
                                transformations are still happening. In the last five years, for example, Rupp has made
                                considerable progresses in many areas including organizational structure, institutional
                                governance, capacity building, infrastructure development, research, teaching and
                                learning, curriculum development, and quality assurance. These achievements have
                                encouraged RUPP management and faculty to strive harder to implement the institutional
                                reform and achieve development goals.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Looking towards the future, Rupp will grasp opportunities and assume a key role in
                                driving Cambodia’s socio-economic development through the creation of human capital and
                                the provision of quality research, training and community service. Rupp aspires to
                                contribute to the achievement of the 2030 and 2050 national development goals of the
                                Royal Government of Cambodia as well as the higher education vision of the Ministry of
                                Education, Youth, and Sport.</p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Against this backdrop, this Strategic Plan 2019-2023 has been developed to guide Rupp in
                                realizing its development vision and goals for the next five years. It will serve as a
                                roadmap for the university to orient its focus and for its sub-units to devise their own
                                action plans accordingly. The strategic plan will move Rupp closer to assuming its place
                                among other national universities in the ASEAN region as a center for intellectual and
                                cultural development.</p>

                            <p>History
                                The Royal University of Phnom Penh first opened its doors as the Royal Khmer University
                                on January 13, 1960, with a National Institute of Judicial and Economic Studies, a Royal
                                School of Medicine, a National School of Commerce, a National Pedagogical Institute, a
                                Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences, and a Faculty of Science and Technology. The
                                language of instruction during this period was French.

                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>With the establishment of the Khmer Republic, the Royal Khmer University became the
                                Phnom Penh University. Between 1965 and 1975 the university consisted of the Ecole
                                Normale Supérieure, the Faculties of Letters and Humanities, Science, Pharmacy, Law and
                                Economics, Medicine and Dentistry, Commerce, Pedagogy and the Language Institute.

                            </p>
                            <br>
                            <p>Between 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge regime forced the cessation of formal education.
                                Schools and universities were closed and destroyed, and teaching services decimated.
                                Along with all other educational institutions in Cambodia, Phnom Penh University ceased
                                to function during this time. The Khmer Rouge targeted the educated, and many of the
                                University’s faculty members were killed. Of the educated people who survived the
                                regime, few chose to remain in Cambodia once its borders reopened. Deserted for almost
                                five years, the campus became another victim of the grim period during the Pol Pot
                                regime.

                            </p><br>
                            <p>In 1980, the Ecole Normale Supérieure reopened, again teaching predominantly in French.
                                The following year saw the opening of the Institute of Foreign Languages (IFL),
                                initially training students to become Vietnamese and Russian language teachers. Both
                                colleges focused on training students to become teachers, thus rebuilding the education
                                system within Cambodia.

                            </p><br>
                            <p>In 1988, the Ecole Normale Supérieure merged with the IFL to create Phnom Penh
                                University. In 1996, the university underwent its final change of name, becoming the
                                Royal University of Phnom Penh.

                            </p><br>
                            <p>During the past decade, the University has continued to grow and now includes the
                                Faculty of Science, Faculty of Social Sciences and Humanities, and the Institute of
                                Foreign Languages. New departments and degree programs are developed regularly to keep
                                up with the changing needs of Cambodian society. In keeping with its commitment to
                                higher education, RUPP began to develop postgraduate degrees at a Masters level since
                                2001.</p>
